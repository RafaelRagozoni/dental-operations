# dental-operations
dental operations crud for pacients

- use mongoDB (pymongo) [tutorial here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_mongodb_getstarted.asp)
  - https://zellwk.com/blog/local-mongodb/ (Precisa instalar o mongosh)
  - https://www.mongodb.com/pt-br/docs/guides/crud/install/
- using Flask or FastAPI
- using PyQt6, Django or Tkinter for UI
- using PyInstaller, Auto-py-to-exe or Nuitka to generate executable

# What is missing:
- try making the app work without anything on the database
- create a "local" procedure dict to save in the database in the procedures window
- make the window to save the operations done in the selected teeth
  - when teeth checkbox checked, open the teeth checkbox with the current operations checked
- make the logic to save user inputs in the database
- create the .exe with PyInstaller
